# My First TypeScript Project ðŸ˜Š

This project is a simple yet functional to-do list application built with TypeScript and JavaScript, 
featuring task persistence via localStorage. It leverages Snowpack as a development environment and uuid for generating unique task IDs.


Features:
Add tasks: Create new tasks with unique IDs using uuid.
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete: Track task status with checkboxes.
Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
Responsive design: Works well on different screen sizes.


Tech Stack:
TypeScript: For strict typing and modern JavaScript features.
JavaScript: Core functionality.
Snowpack: For hot module reloading and bundling during development.
UUID: For generating unique task IDs.
LocalStorage: To store tasks locally in the browser.


How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Snowpack development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser (typically http://localhost:8080).


Development Tools:
Snowpack: For a fast, lightweight development environment.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and ease of development.

# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
